## Order From Chaos

More than a general noise source, Iguanamente provides a musical dive into probability and sampling. 

Two main engines sit at the core of Iguanamente. A deterministic model that we might typically expect out of a noise generator, and a granular model that we designed from scratch specifically to be used for this application. 

___

### Ideas

Use the audio outputs in drum synthesis, deep basslines, and techno pads. 

The CV outputs work well for modulating filters and adding subtle variation to synth voices and effects. 

Send the gate outputs into a resonant filter inputs to make ambient textures.
