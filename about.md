System Lizard brings the sounds of Southern Florida to synthesizers. Taking sonic inspiration from nightclubs, parakeets, palm trees, and of course lizards, we develop powerful electronic audio devices that can take you from the Everglades to South Beach.

Sound exploration and live performance are at the heart of our devices, allowing you to work at a very technical level, but in an intuitive manner.

Founded by lifelong musician, [Rick Howell](https://rick-howell.github.io/), System Lizard began as a way to incorporate mathematics, engineering, and musicianship into one.
